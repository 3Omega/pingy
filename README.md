# Website Availability Monitor

This Python script monitors the availability of specified websites at regular intervals and provides real-time status updates. It utilizes the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the given URLs and checks for successful responses or any warning/error conditions.

## Features:
- Monitors multiple websites for their availability.
- Displays timestamps for success, warning, and error events.
- Adjustable sleep duration between monitoring intervals.

## Usage:
1. Replace the placeholder URLs in the `website_urls` list with the URLs of the websites you want to monitor.
2. Run the script to start monitoring.
3. The script will continuously check the specified websites and print status messages.

Feel free to customize the script according to your needs and integrate it into your monitoring or logging systems.

**Note:** Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (`requests` library) before running the script.

**Disclaimer:** Use this script responsibly and considerate of the websites you are monitoring to avoid any potential impact on their servers.
